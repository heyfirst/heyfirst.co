## 👏 heyfirst.co! 

My personal website has transformed over 10 years since __firstziiz.com__, __ks.in.th__ and now is [heyfirst.co](https://heyfirst.co) - from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), [Ghost 0.8.0](https://ghost.org/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.com) and then now [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next).

My purpose for this personal website is keeping everything about my experiences, my knowledges, my thoughts, my opinions, yay! And also try to experiment **every practice** I have into this web app!

### Disclaimer

This website cloned from [leerob.io](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io), every nice portfolio website built by [@leerob](https://github.com/leerob), Head of DevRel ▲ vercel which has many good practice and technique to maximize NextJS superpowers.
 
I have changed to my own UI + code styles, Javascript to TypeScript, adding some animation graphics, adding another sections! 


### Overview
* `pages/api/*` -  API routes powering `viewsCount` on every blogs by Supabase.io
* `pages/blogs/*` - Static pre-rendered blog pages using MDX.
* `pages/books/*` - [Upcoming] Static pre-rendered __bookshelfs__ pages using MDX.
* `pages/*` - All other static pages, e.g. home, about, etc...

### Running Locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heyfirst/heyfirst.co.git
$ cd heyfirst.co
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

> Personally, I prefer NPM because many times I had conflict with global packages when using yarn and npm in the same machine. So keep it simple and use NPM!
