# Context

## Project Overview

This is First Sutham's personal blog/portfolio website built with Astro. The site serves as a platform for sharing technical knowledge, experiences, and insights about software development.

## Purpose

- Share technical knowledge and learnings
- Document personal experiences and insights
- Establish thought leadership in the developer community
- Provide value to other developers through practical content

## Target Audience

- Software developers at all levels
- Tech enthusiasts
- People interested in software engineering practices
- Developer experience and best practices

## Content Focus

- Technical tutorials and guides
- Developer experience insights
- Personal experiences and learnings
- Best practices and patterns
- Debugging and problem-solving

## Site Structure

- Homepage with featured content
- Blog posts (/posts/)
- About page (planned)
- Notes page (planned)
- Uses page (planned)
- Projects page (planned)

## Best Practice (Coding and style patterns)

### Writing Style Patterns

- **Casual, friendly tone**: "Heyo!", "I found something cool...", "Let me know what you think!"
- **Personal experience-based**: Share real experiences and discoveries from actual work
- **Problem-first approach**: Start with the pain point, then present solutions
- **Visual elements**: Use emojis strategically (ðŸš¨, ðŸ’¡, âœ¨, ðŸš€, ðŸ“Š, ðŸŽ¯, ðŸ”§)
- **Practical focus**: Emphasize real-world applications over theory
- **Engaging conclusions**: End with encouragement and invite discussion

### Technical Content Patterns

- **TypeScript examples**: Use TypeScript throughout, not JavaScript
- **Production-ready code**: Prefer real working code over simplified examples
- **Real-world scenarios**: Show actual implementations from your work
- **Development vs production**: Always consider both environments
- **Code with context**: Include comments explaining the "why", not just the "what"
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, then show advanced implementations

### Blog Structure Patterns

- **Hook with discovery**: "I found something cool..." or "I learned..."
- **Problem identification**: Clear pain point that readers can relate to
- **Practical solutions**: Code-heavy sections with working examples
- **Real examples**: Use actual code from your projects when possible
- **Authentic voice**: Write from personal experience, not theoretical knowledge

### Code Style Preferences

- **Prefer real code**: Use actual production implementations over simplified examples
- **Include error handling**: Show how to handle edge cases and failures
- **Performance considerations**: Mention when techniques might impact performance
- **Environment awareness**: Different behavior for dev vs production
- **Structured logging**: Focus on practical logging and monitoring solutions
- **Debugging tools**: Emphasize tools that help with real debugging scenarios
