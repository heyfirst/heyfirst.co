Hey! I'm Kanisorn Sutham, or a.k.a **"First"**. Ya, people call me that.

I'm currently a software engineer at [Unity](https://unity.com). I'm working on their _huge_ client-facing web application. Applying every software engineering practice I learn so far since my first career to make things great!

I love to spend my spare time building cool stuff as well! Many things I love to learn in each quarter. Check on my [GitHub](https://github.com/heyfirst) where I maintain my pet-project or build up my playground space. Yes! including [heyfirst.co](https://github.com/heyfirst/heyfirst.co/) repository as well!

You can also find me my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyfirst_) where I talk and retweet about software development.
