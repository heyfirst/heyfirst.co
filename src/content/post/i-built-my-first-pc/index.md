1. I wrote story about this in /r/radeon as well

## Prelim

When I move to Finland almost 4 years ago in October 2021, I was really exciting about everything as they all news to me.
First time living in different country, thousands kilometers from home (Thailand) but that doesn't last long

In December same year, Just 2 months after I arrived, live and working, I almost got extreamly sad moment (not sure if this is kind of depression tho?), I am really unhappy and I don't want to do anything. At that time, one suggest me to maybe buy Nindento Switch, playing game might help a lot in Finland and this kind of depressed weather.

I end up bought it and that was the right decision! A 399 Euro of Nintendo Switch OLED. That was the first time I am really into gaming. It helps me pass the brutal winter of Finland.

I am Mac-user since 2013, with Macbook air 2013 and eversince, I never use Windows or play any games at all. Only coding as a hobbies.

## Games I love

Not just any game or competitive gaming I want to play. I am selective person. I like to read a lot back then and when it comes to games that immerse me are the (J)RPG or story-rich games

I worked at [Unity](https://unity.com) during that time in Helsinki, Finland. Everyone here really-really play games, I got a lot of suggestions from colleauges, and there are 3 that changes me forever

1. Octopath Traveler 1 and 2
2. Witcher 3: Wild hunt
3. Zelda Breath of the wild

It's ordered in the way of my favorite games of all time and they all start from this Nintendo Switch in 2021.

## Upgrade?

Fast forward to 2024-2025, there are more games I play, alone and with friends, the wave of Baldur Gate 3, and recently, Clair obscur: Expedition 33 (or E33). and Fortnite / Dota 2 with friends here in Helsinki. Fortunately, Geforce Now allow me to play these 3 games through my Macbook Air M1 on 4K monitor with smooth 120fps.

But there is a downside of Geforce Now, It could play Baldur Gate 3 very nicely as it's turn-based game but when it comes to E33 or Fortnite, a small input lag, or network issue between me and Geforce Now rack could cause deadly panelty, especially in E33 in Act 3 that you are force to "parry" only to win the game. That's when I think about upgrade, and you know what, PC is not in the list at all.

There are PS5 Slim Disc (519 Euro), Steam Deck (599 Euro), and Nintendo Switch 2 (569 Euro) in my list in March 2025. There's Pros/Cons in each one but they are affortable.

- **PS5** â€” they are powerful, ready to play with 4K/120FPS. I can 100% sure that all the games will works perfectly fine as they optimized for this console. But I need to buy all games I want again as some of my games are in Steam.
- **Steam Deck** â€” Good compromised, all my games is there, I have all communities, achievements, and more. But many recent RPG games won't be able to play _beautifully_ with Steam Deck as it's hardware limit (Of course, it's handheld)
- **Nintendo Switch 2** â€” At that time, we don't know any detail yet but I think I would go with it because I have Nintendo Switch OLED but at the end, I did not buy it on Day 1 even though I save money for it already 2 months before release. Same reason as well as PS5, it doesn't have all my game in Steam, or games I want to play.

In 5 of July, 1 month after Nintendo Switch 2 released, I went to one of our friends house warming and after the party, it's the day I decide to buy the PC.

## What? Where is PC decision come from ðŸ˜‚

I have the same question too, why PC comes out of nowhere. It is beacuse one of my friends who works in AMD, who also went to house warming party. He helps me walkthrough all PC hardwares and help me understand each parts.

It feel like I was back when I was 6 years ago, when I, first time, play PC in internet cafes back then. When I start playing Ragnarok and Pang ya. Childhood die hard right?.

And after that, I watch 20+ of YouTube videos, many GPU+CPU combination performence reviews in real games. Until 3-4 days later I found the good combination I want which is AMD Ryzen 5 CPU 7600(X) and AMD Radeon 9070 XT GPU. This is for gaming and gaming alone, I do LLMs and AI stuff, I mostly use OpenRouter for my side project, so there is no need for Nvidia GPU which is 30-40% pricy with the same performance.

I plan to go white built as it will match with my mood and tone of room, but all white would mean boring so I try to get all parts in 20% black and 80% white. So the end result would be perfectly balance.

GPU is the hardest part, because of there is many manufactorer making this, I choose XFX because Reddits praise about them (as well as Sapphire) and I got this XFX Quicksilver 9070 XT White Gaming Edition in a very good price (~650 Euro, originally 725 Euro). they are not pure white, there is some black color which will be a good match in my imagination.

Motherboard, I go with MSI B650 Gaming Plus Wifi as they have Wifi and bluetooth modules, it will works with my Logitech MX Master 3s (I use it for work but gaming too, it's fine), Nuphy Bluetooth keyboard, and 8Bitdo Pro 2 Bluetooth Controller. and they are black and white color too.

I also got suggestion from a friend himself that AMD CPU works well with 6000HMZ DDR5 CL30 Ram, so I got Kingston Fury white because I think it's a good brand, same as SSD M.2 with WD_BLACK as it's also a good brand. PSU (power supply unit) need to be white so that the cable will also be white too, and lastly, the CPU fan, I choose Thermalright Peerless 120 SE white as well.

Here's the end result, my current built of my PC

## Any difficulty in assemble and setup?

Yes, there is a lot but not that hard. Thanks for many Youtubers, I am succesfully install without break any parts from all tips I learned from you guys.

The diffuculty would go to something after assemble and install, such as

1. CPU stock fan is bad â€” it does not cold down CPU at all, the CPU run 70c degree in idle and when I start the games, it run 93c degree within 5 minutes after start the game. I thought I install in the wrong way. So I bought Arctic MX-6 to repaste again and again, 3 times! And I almost give up and return CPU as I thought it might be bad CPU. Turns out it's the fan itself. After I decide to buy Thermalright PA 120SE fan to replace the stock fan, My CPU never goes over 75c degree ever again and run 45c degree in idle. Yah, stock fan, you are the real culprit!
2. GPU sagging â€” XFX GPU is huge by default, and much bigger and heavier than others 9070 XT GPU in the market, due to that they give us the anti-sag bar but unfortunately, that the cap between GPU and bottom of the case is small, so I need to put Lego to hold it instead, At the end, it works and it gives some gimmick to my PC too, I like it.
3. MSI Motherboard come with the 1-time driver installer software, that if you accidentally close it, it will never show up again. It happens to me when I install many programs and drivers in the same time, and I accidentally restart the PC while driver installation is not finished yet. I need to clean re-install Windows once again to get the MSI driver installer to work ðŸ˜‚ in this PC built, I clean-install Windows twice!
4. Cable management is love-hate relationship, I love my current cable management right now but it's never end. When I watch other Youtuber, I redo cable 5 times in total, cut a lot of cable zip ties, but at the end, it's worth it.
5. I initially don't want the RGB fan because it's waste of money, but XFX Quicksilver GPU have a white-light in XFX logo that need to unplug manually and Thermalright PA 120SE have ARGB fan come with it. Now I need all fans to have ARGB ðŸ˜‚ but this will be my next upgrade with a good cable extension and cable comb!

## Do I happy or regrets? with this decision

Surely, I am happy with this built, It allows me to play all games I want and now I explores many games in 4k 120-240Hz, I even replay Octopath Traveler 2 again in PC because it can goes to 4k with 120Hz, so all skills and effects are really-really looks good.

I am currently start playing Ghost of Tsushima, a breathtaking scenary game of all time from me. It's like Witcher 3 + God of wars (I play it about 20min in PS5 at Unity office while ago) and it's huge!

So, overall, it's a good decision so far ðŸ™‚

I want to write this here so that I don't forget this experience, it's meaningful and fulfill. this involve lots of friends in Finland, and also in Thailand to help me makes this possible. Thanks everyone!
