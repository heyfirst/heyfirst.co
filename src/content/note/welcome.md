Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Today marks the first day I've moved my entire personal blog from [Remix](https://remix.run/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/)!

A huge thanks to [Chris Williams](https://github.com/chrismwilliams) for the [Cactus theme](https://github.com/chrismwilliams) - it works beautifully right out of the box.
I've been a big fan of the Cactus theme since its Hugo days, and I'm thrilled to see it available for Astro.

Someone might ask why I didn't create my own theme. Well, I've decided to step back from theme development for now. ðŸ« 
These days, my work _primarily_ revolves around backend systems, messaging, distributed systems, and high-performance PostgreSQL.

Frontend skills have gradually become less central to my daily professional life.

I may return to contribute to the frontend space someday, but not just yet! ðŸ™‚

I'll be sharing more technical content and coding insights here, while my other writing will primarily appear on my [Substack](https://heyfirst.substack.com/).

Looking forward to see with you all here!
