I accidentally joined the cycling class at the gym. Well, initially, I expected just a 45 or 60-minutes cycling class, having some fun, and getting energized for the day.

It turns out to be a 120-minutes cycling workout. 😂 I asked the trainer that _"hello, should you also speak in English when you give instruction?"_

then said she _"of course! just one thing to mention, you should not all-in in our first hour, you need to keep some energy for the latter hour"._

At that point, I realize that this is going to turn out badly for sure.

But guess what? We can not simply leave, right? we can not just give up.. that will be very embarrassing.. So whatever happens, happens.

That is where this story begins...

## Thai CEO said running helps you get more EQ.

[Rawit Hanutsaha](https://twitter.com/rawithanutsaha?lang=en), CEO of Srichand has said in Thai on [STEP LIFE: Running Story EP.1 Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYG5sK84_O4) that when he start running for fews month, both his family and staff noted significant improvements in his emotional intelligence (EQ).

I kind of feel the same way about starting to run and finishing my first half-marathon in May 2022. The running changed me. When I got back to work on the weekdays after the run, I realized that I had felt so peaceful. I believe I am capable of handling everything.

I have no idea why this happened because I wasn't yet questioning myself at that day.

## My teammate who run for improving both physical & mental health

There is an other story, the guy who love running like me. When we were on our way to a lunch restaurant, he once told me. He once told me, "We run, we hurt, and we keep running, suffering." Well, I fully agree with him. Well, I couldn't agree more with him.

Running is good for both your body and mind. You need to be mentally and physically strong enough to convince yourself to keep going and not give up. (even if the pain in your legs may make you cry, LOL!)

> "Suffering make you stronger" — I don't know who said that...

## 120-minutes cycling class

Someone might wonder why I suffer after 120-minutes cycling. I've completed a half-marathon before. Well, "why not" 😂

120-minutes or 2 hours is almost the same time I use for finishing a half-marathon. The difference is that I trained for a half-marathon day for two months. But this surprisingly long cycling class on the lazy-morning Sunday isn't what I prepare for.

To get back to the main point, I had already started a workout session on my apple watch when the session began. By the way, [Heart Rate Zones](https://support.apple.com/en-il/guide/watch/apd30fa26bb4/watchos) is a cool feature in the new watchOS!

My strategy is to keep myself around zone 2 as much as possible. Not a relaxing cycling session for muscle recovery—we're here to work out!

> There are a fun fact about me, For many years, I believed that 145BPM heart rate is in zone 3, but turns out it's zone 2 which is actually between 145 and 156 beats per minute. 🤬 WHAT DA FISH! 🐟

I stiffen up more to raise my heart rate to zone 2, but the cycling machine feels incredibly heavy. I can not decrease a stiffness because it will bring my heart-rate down to zone 1. I NEED zone 2!

I'm in pain, as you can see, haha. There are still 90 minutes to go after the first 30...

The workout split to blue-green-yellow section

- 🔵 Blue is a light workout or a recovery
- 🟢 Green is a normal workout
- 🟡 Yellow is a intensive workout

We climb up from blue to green and yellow and then turns to blue for recovery. In this session, there are three waves (the picture is below). When we play on the yellow section, I expect that my heart rate will be in the zone 3–4 range. and keep zone 2 range in the green area.

But as soon as the first yellow section appeared. Our trainer advised us to hold back and tighten up. I was suffering between increasing stiffness to enter zone 3-4 range or balancing my energy for the last hour.

It continued to suffer until the first wave has passed and when we are in the first recovery, my watch indicates that I am in zone 3 range even though my leg feels numb. Everyone in the room is tired, but they aren't giving up (obviously, they couldn't).

Okay, be serious now! However, I don't think it was all that difficult during the first wave. The only thing screaming at me is my own mind: _"You need to balance, slow it down, you won't finish this, etc."_ But in reality, I just need to dive in and try it. Just begin, and keep going until finish.

## Lesson learned

After the session, I thanks to the trainer, she is incredibly energized and funny, I then stretch and cool down. I changed clothes in the locker room and sat down to get ready for the sauna and shower.

Looking back on that, I realize that I just learned a valuable lesson. Long workout at least improved me as a person. It goes beyond simply increasing muscle durability. it improved my mindset. Additionally, it has taught me how to control my thoughts, be positive, and try it out before judging. As a result, I feel very good about myself.

if you have read this far. I want you to try a long workout session. it can be 120-minutes cycling class like me? or whatever you choose. You will undoubtedly change after completing them. believe me!

Also, don't forget to bring a bottle of water! Have fun, stay hydrated, and stay active! 😜
